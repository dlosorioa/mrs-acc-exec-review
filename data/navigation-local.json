In coursework, dissertations and funded research, SoA EBD work with hospital systems, corporate partners, design firms, and research collaborators inside and outside Georgia Tech, including Psychology, Systems Engineering and Computer Science, to explore questions such as how the layout of hospitals and clinics can affect patient health, satisfaction, experience and sleep, how building design can support collaboration and coordination among care teams, how Ebola centers can be best designed to eliminate infection risk, and other issues. SoA EBD researchers have also examined how the design of buildings and sites can support everyday physical activity, how courthouses can be designed to improve the transparency of the legal system, and other issues.",

      "description":"Sport and architecture are two elements of contemporary life that have a broad and profound impact on the world around us. The role architecture plays in shaping buildings and societies has occupied historians for centuries. Likewise the cultural, economic, and political importance of sport is the subject of sustained academic inquiry. When sport and architecture converge, as in the 2012 London Olympics or the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, then the impact of these two forms of social activity is redoubled. Research at the School of Architecture focuses on the ways these structures are constructed, the ends to which they are used, and the nature of public reaction to them.",

Beyond the “hard” physical structures and systems necessary for the secure, healthy and efficient functioning of cities, new “soft” blue and green infrastructures are providing eco-system services at multiple scales. Ecological infrastructure is fundamental to urban design, weaving together community design and environmental engineering.

Of particular interest in the School of Architecture is - what is their impact on the design of the built environment and the configuration of public space? Research is helping communities rethink the design of streets, parking, and transit systems in relation to autonomous vehicles. Studies are expanding techniques from high-performance architecture into high-performance urbanism, integrating improved delivery of public services with big data mapping and parametric technologies.",
